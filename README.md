# InstaAPI

## Features

 - I used MVVM design pattern 
 - Developed with UIKit.
 - API is "https://instagram120.p.rapidapi.com/api/instagram"
 - I made it with Storyboards
 - URLSession is used for Network Request
 - I used a generic type to be able to use all models in a single network layer.
 - I used the singleton architecture in all managers because it allows them to be instantiated only once and kept in memory throughout the application's lifetime.

   
## Third-Party Libraries
 - SnapKit
 - SDWebImage
